Please be consistent with the existing coding style.

Block style:

bool Function(char* psz, int n)
{
    // Comment summarising what this section of code does
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // When something fails, return early
        if (!Something())
            return false;
        ...
    }

    // Success return is usually at the end
    return true;
}

- ANSI/Allman block style
- 4 space indenting, no tabs
- No extra spaces inside parenthesis; please don't do ( this )
- No space after function names, one space after if, for and while

Variable names begin with the type in lowercase, like nSomeVariable.
Please don't put the first word of the variable name in lowercase like
someVariable.

n       integer number: short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int,
            int64, uint64, sometimes char if used as a number
d       double, float
